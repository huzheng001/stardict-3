Description: International dictionary for GNOME
 StarDict is a cross-platform and international dictionary written in
 GTK. It has powerful features such as "Glob-style pattern
 matching", "Scan selection word", "Fuzzy search", etc.
 .
 This package is compiled with GNOME support and contains only the
 program of stardict and will be of limited use without the dictionary
 files. For more information about how to get the dictionary files,
 please read /usr/share/doc/stardict/README.Debian.
